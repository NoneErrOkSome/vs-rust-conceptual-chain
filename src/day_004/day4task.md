### Day 4 Challenge: Control Flow in Rust

For today's challenge, we will focus on implementing various control structures in Rust, including if-else statements, match expressions, loops, and more. These exercises will help you solidify your understanding of Rust's control flow mechanisms and provide practical experience in writing concise and efficient code.

#### **🎯 Task 1: Conditional Logic**
Write a Rust program that takes two integers and prints whether they are equal, the first is greater, or the second is greater using if-else statements.

#### **🎯 Task 2: FizzBuzz with Match Expression**
Implement the classic FizzBuzz problem using a match expression. Iterate through numbers from 1 to 100, printing "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if it's divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if it's divisible by both 3 and 5. For other numbers, print the number itself.

#### **🎯 Task 3: Using Nested Loops**
Create a program that prints a right-angled triangle using asterisks (*) with nested loops. Allow the user to input the number of rows.

#### **🎯 Task 4: Pattern Matching with Enums**
Define an enum representing traffic light colors (Red, Yellow, Green). Write a function that takes a traffic light color and returns the amount of time (in seconds) that the light stays on that color. Use pattern matching.

#### **🎯 Task 5: Looping with `while` and `for`**
Write two versions of a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10. Use `while` loop for the first version and `for` loop for the second version.

#### **🎯 Task 6: Fibonacci Sequence with Recursion**
Implement a recursive function that calculates the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence. Test it by printing the first 10 elements.

#### **🎯 Task 7: Iterating Over a Vector with `for` Loop**
Create a vector of strings representing a list of tasks. Iterate over the vector using a `for` loop and print each task.

#### **🎯 Task 8: Optional Advanced Task - Game Loop**
Design a simple text-based game (like a guessing game) that utilizes various control flow structures including loops for the game loop, if-else for decisions, and match for handling user input.

### Summary
These tasks are designed to test your understanding of Rust's control flow constructs. Make sure to approach each task methodically, applying the appropriate control structure for the given problem. Feel free to experiment with different solutions and don't hesitate to ask if you need guidance or clarification on any task. Happy coding! 🎉
